      <p>Now you show your four cards to be all face-down, by counting them one
      at a time, using the Four-as-Four-move. This move is an ingenious
      adaption by Alex Elmsley of a move first given to us by Edward 'Victor in
      his "E-Y-E" effect. The Four-as-Four move was described in Dai's "More
      Inner Secrets of Card Magic", but to be complete I will give it
      again.</p>
